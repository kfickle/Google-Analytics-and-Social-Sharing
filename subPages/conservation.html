        <h2>Endangered Status</h2>

        <p> The red panda is listed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES#Appendix_I">CITES Appendix I.</a> The species has been classified as endangered in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List">IUCN Red List</a> since 2008 because the global population is estimated at about 10,000 individuals, with a decreasing population trend; only about half of the total area of potential habitat of 142,000 km(55,000 sq mi) is actually being used by the species. </p>

        <h2>Population</h2>
        <p> Due to their shy and secretive nature, and their largely nocturnal habits, observation of red pandas is difficult. Therefore, population figures in the wild are determined by population density estimates and not direct counts. Worldwide population estimates range from fewer than 2,500 to between 16,000 and 20,000 individuals. Reliable population numbers are hard to find, partly because other animals have been mistaken for the red panda. For instance, one report from Burma stated that red pandas were still fairly common in some areas, and was accompanied by a photograph of a "red panda" as proof. The photograph in question depicted a species of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civet">civet.</a> </p>

        <h2>Hunting Regulations</h2>
        <p>The red panda is protected in all range countries, and hunting is illegal.[1] Beyond this, conservation efforts are highly variable between countries:</p>
        <ul class="protectedAreas">
            <li>China has 35 protected areas covering about 42.4% of red panda habitat.</li>

            <li>India has 20 protected areas with known or possible red panda populations in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and West Bengal such as Khangchendzonga National Park, Namdapha National Park, and Singalila National Park, and a coordinated conservation policy for the red panda.</li>

            <li>In Nepal, known populations occur in Langtang National Park, Sagarmatha National Park, Makalu Barun National Park, Rara National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area, Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, and in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve.</li>

            <li>Bhutan has five protected areas that support red panda populations.</li>

            <li>Burma has 26 protected areas, of which at least one hosts red panda populations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preservation through Captivity</h2>
        <p>The red panda is quite adaptable to living in captivity, and is common in zoos worldwide. By 1992, more than 300 births had occurred in captivity, and more than 300 individuals lived in 85 institutions worldwide. By 2001, 182 individuals were housed in North American zoos alone. As of 2006, the international studbook listed more than 800 individuals in zoos and parks around the world.</p>
